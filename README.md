# Optimizers-analysis-on-predicting-diabetes-using-Logistic-Regression

## This repository also includes a research report analyzing the effectiveness of different optimizers applied to a Logistic Regression model for predicting diabetes.

The study covers:

- Manual implementation of Logistic Regression
- Comparative evaluation of Batch, Mini-Batch, and Momentum-based SGD optimizers
- Feature selection using Chi-Square and VIF
- Use of regularization techniques including L2 Regularization and Early Stopping
- Evaluation on the BRFSS2015 dataset
